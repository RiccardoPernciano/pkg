## Introduction

The **pkg** repository is designed to support MinIO projects by providing reusable packages. These packages streamline development and reduce redundancy. By centralizing common functionality, we enhance maintainability and promote best practices across projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with the **pkg** repository, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine. This will allow you to explore the packages and integrate them into your MinIO projects.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Git installed on your machine.
- Familiarity with Go programming language, as most packages are written in Go.

### Cloning the Repository

Use the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RiccardoPernciano/pkg.git
```

After cloning, navigate into the directory:

```bash
cd pkg
```

## Installation

You can download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/RiccardoPernciano/pkg/releases). Follow the instructions provided for each release to install the packages.

### Executing the Downloaded File

Once you have downloaded the release, follow these steps to execute it:

1. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
2. Use the command:

   ```bash
   ./your_downloaded_file
   ```

Replace `your_downloaded_file` with the actual file name.

## Usage

Using the packages in this repository is straightforward. After installation, you can import the packages into your Go projects.

### Importing Packages

To import a package, use the following syntax in your Go file:

```go
import "github.com/RiccardoPernciano/pkg/your_package"
```

Replace `your_package` with the specific package you want to use.

### Example

Here is a simple example demonstrating how to use one of the packages:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/RiccardoPernciano/pkg/example_package"
)

func main() {
    result := example_package.DoSomething()
    fmt.Println(result)
}
```
